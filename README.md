My incoming mains poly pipe are at DN25 while Turbine Meter above is DN40!!<br /><br />Had to search hardware shops around down and landed one shop that was able to provide me with 1 1/2" to 3/4" fitting but in galvanized metal. Pair this with DN25 to 3/4" poly couplers. |

These alarm panel comes in 4 core which is enough for transducers. <br /><br /><br />Since these cables are also not meant for sun/rain/heat - I covered put these cables in 7mm corrugated PVC cables from local electrical shop.
